        <!--Terms explained-->
        <a id="terms_resolution"></a>
        <h2>Resolution</h2>
        <img src="images/Guide/eumolpo-resolution.jpg" alt="Resolution" width="60%">
        <figcaption class="img_source">Source: <a href="https://eumolpo.blogspot.com/2019/12/2-1080p-monitors-resolution.html" target="_blank">Eumolpo</a></figcaption>
        <p>A monitor's resolution describes the visual dimension of any given display. It is expressed in terms of width x height with the unit in pixels. For example, a monitor with the resolution of 1920x1080 has a width of 1920 pixels and a height of 1080 pixels. The higher the resolution of a monitor, the more detailed an image will be as the higher resolution monitor has more pixels than a lower resolution monitor. Additionally, a higher resolution monitor allows more space for content which makes them good choices for multi-tasking. Typically, Higher resolution monitors will be also larger in size and also more expensive. Some of the common monitor resolutions found in the monitor market are 1080p (FHD), 1440p (QHD) and 4K (UHD).</p>
        <p>For work, it is recommended to get a higher resolution such as 1440p (QHD) and 4K (UHD) as it can display images and text more sharper. Furthermore, it allows more space for content which makes them good choices for multi-tasking.</p>
        <p>For gaming, it depends based on how strong your PC is and the type of games you play. The higher the resolution of the monitor, the more Frames Per Second (FPS) will be reduced which leads to gameplay being less smooth. So if you want to play games in high resolutions, you will need a strong PC that will fit your performance requirements (60, 144, 240 FPS). If you mostly play single player games, it is beneficial to get higher resolutions such as 4K (UHD) as it will add a lot more details making the game more immersive and looking better. If you mostly like to play competitive shooters such as Counter-Strike and Call of Duty, it is beneficial to get a lower resolution monitor such as 1080p (FHD) so that you will have more FPS and you will have less input lag and smoother gameplay. If you like to play a variety of games, it is recommended to get a 1440p monitor as you can have more detail and FPS is not reduced as much as 4K.</p>

        <a id="terms_refresh_rate"></a>
        <h2>Refresh Rate</h2>
        <img src="images/Guide/intel-refresh-rate.jpg" alt="Refresh Rate Example" width="60%">
        <figcaption class="img_source">Refresh Rate Comparison (Source: <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/gaming/resources/highest-refresh-rate-gaming.html" target="_blank">Intel</a>)</figcaption>
        <p>A monitor's refresh rate refers to how many times per second the screen refreshes the image on it. It is measured in hertz (Hz), and the higher the number the more times per second the monitor refreshes. For example, if you have a 144 Hz monitor, it will refresh 144 times per second. The higher the refresh rate, the smoother the image will appear. Additionally, the higher the refresh rate, the higher the monitor will also cost.</p>
        <p>For work, it is recommended to get a 60Hz monitor since higher refresh rates will cost more and there are only few applications outside of gaming that benefit from high refresh rate.
        <p>For gaming, it depends on what games you play. If you only play casual and single-player games, 60 Hz monitors should suffice since you do not get much benefits from having the game being smoother from higher refresh rate. If you play fast-paced shooters, it is recommended to get a 144Hz or above monitor as there are many benefits. Benefits being lower input lag, better motion clarity which allows tracking of targets better, seeing players earlier, less distracting effects and finally, smoother gameplay. To learn more about the benefits of high refresh rate, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsnVuXj_IDM" target="_blank">check out this video by NVIDIA</a>. To make sure that you are getting the full benefits of a high refresh rate monitor, you should ensure that your system is up to the task. For example, if you have a 144Hz monitor, your system should at least output 144 FPS in the game for an ideal experience.</p>

        <a id="terms_size"></a>
        <h2>Size</h2>
        <img src="images/Guide/wepc-size.jpg" alt="Monitor Size" width="60%">
        <figcaption class="img_source">Source: <a href="https://www.wepc.com/gaming-monitor/guide/best-monitor-size-for-gaming/" target="_blank">WePC</a></figcaption>
        <p>A monitor's size is measured diagonally, and it is expressed in terms of inches. In the monitor market, there are 3 common sizes being 24 inches, 27 inches and 32 inches. When choosing what size to get, it depends on resolution and how far you are sitting from the screen. Additionally you have to account for Pixel Per Inch which will affect how the quality of the image will be.</p>
        <h3>Pixel Per Inch (PPI)</h3>
        <p>PPI is the measurement of the pixel density of a screen. It is the ratio between a monitor's size and its resolution. The higher the pixel density, the more detailed and spacious the image is. In contrast, displays with low pixel density will have less screen space and more blurry image quality. When comparing between a 24 inch 1080p monitor and a 32 inch 1080p monitor, the 24 inch monitor has a pixel density of 92 PPI while the 32 inch monitor has a pixel density of 70 PPI. This means the 24 inch monitor has a sharper image than the 32 inch monitor.</p>
        <h3>Recommended Sizes</h3>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.2em; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>1080p - 23-25 inches</li>
            <li>1440p - 27-32 inches</li>
            <li>4K - 27-32+ inches</li>
        </ul>

        <a id="terms_panel"></a>
        <h2>Panel Type</h2>
        <p>In the monitor market, there are 3 common panel types that are being sold. They are Twisted Nematic (TN) panels, Vertical Alignment (VA) panels and In-Plane Switching (IPS) panels.</p>
        <p>TN panels are the cheapest amongst the 3, have fast <a href="#terms_response_time">response times </a> and have low input lag. However, they have the worst colour reproduction and inaccurate colours which makes them unsuitable for design work. Additionally, they have poor viewing angles which the image will look distorted or inaccurate when viewing off center.</p>
        <p>VA panels have the best <a href="#terms_contrast_ratio">contrast ratio</a> amongst the 3, ranging from 2000:1 to 4000:1 compared to TN and IPS which has 1000:1. This means that blacks will be deeper and colours will be more vivid. Compared to TNs, VA panels have better colour reproduction but it gets outclassed by IPS. For the downsides, VA panels suffer from slower pixel response times amongst the 3. What this means is that in dark scenes of fast-paced games, you can notice black trails behind fast-moving objects which can be distracting for competitive gaming.</p>
        <p>IPS panels have the best and accurate colour reproduction amongst the 3, great viewing angles, have decent contrast ratio and fast enough response times for most usages. This makes IPS panels the "Jack of all Trades". However, IPS panels are the most expensive amongst the 3 and they are not as good as VA in terms of contrast ratio. In recent years, IPS panels are getting faster response times which can compete with TN panels so there is more incentive to get an IPS panel if you want fast response times of a TN panel and great colour reproduction of an IPS panel.</p>
        <p>For office work, a VA or IPS panel is recommended as they can display great colours and have good viewing angles. For colour critical work such as photo-editing, an IPS panel is recommended as it has the most accurate colour reproduction.</p>
        <p>If you only play story-based single-player games, a VA panel is recommended as it can help being immersed into the games' environments due to the higher contrast ratio which gives deeper blacks. If you are a competitive gamer that wants the best response times and the lowest input lag, a TN panel is recommended but IPS panels are closer to being as good as TN panels so you should keep an eye on them. If you play a variety of games, IPS panels are recommended.</p>

        <a id="terms_viewing_angles"></a>
        <h2>Viewing Angles</h2>
        <p>A viewing angle is the maximum angular distance from looking in front of a screen to looking from the side without a change of brightness or colours.</p>

        <a id="terms_contrast_ratio"></a>
        <h2>Contrast Ratio</h2>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/Guide/lightform-contrast-ratio.jpg" alt="Contrast Ratio Comparison" width="60%">
            <figcaption class="img_source">Contrast Ratio Comparison (Source: <a href="https://guide.lightform.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010525294-Understanding-Contrast-Ratio" target="_blank">Lightform</a>)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Contrast ratio is the ratio between the luminance of the brightest white and the darkest black that a monitor can produce. Higher contrast ratios typically mean deeper blacks, which makes a big difference in overall picture quality. It has particular importance for dark scenes in movies and games, especially in a dark room.</p> 

        <a id="terms_response_time"></a>
        <h2>Response Time</h2>
        <p>Response Time is the time a pixel takes to shift from one colour to another. This is usually measured in the time it takes to go from black to white back again to black expressed in milliseconds (ms). A typical monitor's response time can range from under 10 ms to being as fast as 1 ms. The longer/slower the response time, the longer there will be a black trail following moving objects will be. This is called ghosting and it can be quite distracting if you use your monitor for gaming or watching sports. The shorter/lower the response time, the less likely you are to face ghosting.</p>
        <p>For work, response times is not that important since when surfing the internet, writing e-mails, word processing or image editing, the delay between changing colours on the screen is so fast that you cannot notice it.</p>
        <p>For gaming, you should ideally get the lowest response times like 1-5 ms to avoid ghosting effects when gaming.</p>

        <a id="terms_adaptive_sync"></a>
        <h2>Adaptive Sync</h2>
        <p>Adaptive Sync is the dynamic adjustment of a monitor's refresh rate to the content played. Adaptive sync eliminates screen tearing, stuttering and juddering and it enables a smooth gaming experience even if your computer may not render the game at the frame rate that is equal to your monitor's refresh rate. In the monitor market, there are two technologies that are marketed with this feature: FreeSync which is developed by AMD, and G-SYNC which is developed by NVIDIA. They are very similar functions but there are some differences.</p>
        <h3>FreeSync</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/Guide/amd-freesync.jpg" alt="AMD FreeSync" width="70%">
            <figcaption class="img_source">Source: <a href="https://community.amd.com/t5/blogs/introducing-amd-freesync-premium-and-amd-freesync-premium-pro/ba-p/414261" target="_blank">AMD</a></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>FreeSync uses the Adaptive Sync standard built into the DisplayPort 1.2a standard, and later HDMI. Freesync adds no real cost to a monitor and it can work over HDMI and DisplayPort on FreeSync certified monitors with AMD graphics cards. FreeSync is widely available from office style monitors to gaming monitors. Do note that if you own a 10-series or newer NVIDIA graphics cards (e.g GTX 1060, RTX 2060 or RTX 3060) and use DisplayPort, you can use G-SYNC on FreeSync monitors.</p>
        <h3>G-SYNC</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/Guide/nvidia-gsync.jpg" alt="NVIDIA G-SYNC" width="50%">
            <figcaption class="img_source">Source: <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/g-sync" target="_blank">NVIDIA</a></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>G-SYNC is NVIDIA's proprietary Adaptive Sync technology. G-SYNC uses a module that replaces standard display scalers which adds cost to the monitor and it only works on Display on G-SYNC monitors with NVIDIA graphics cards. G-SYNC has additional benefits such as lower input lag, blur reduction in the form of backlight strobing (ULMB) and wider Adaptive Sync range than FreeSync.</p> 

        <a id="terms_ergonomics"></a>
        <h2>Ergonomics/Fully Adjustable Stand</h2>
        <p>If you are spending long hours in front of a computer every day, not having an ergonomic monitor can lead to muscle fatigue, neck or back pain and eye strain. Getting a monitor with a fully adjustable stand can help solve these issues and you can adjust it to your needs. A fully adjustable stand should have 4 functions being pivot, swivel, height adjustment and tilt.</p>
        <figure id="ergo_examples">
            <figure>
                <img src="images/Guide/viewsonic-pivot.jpg" alt="Pivot">
                <figcaption>Pivot allows you to rotate the monitor from landscape to potrait mode and vice versa.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/Guide/viewsonic-swivel.jpg" alt="Swivel">
                <figcaption>Swivel allows you to turn the monitor to the left or right.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/Guide/viewsonic-height-adjustment.jpg" alt="Height adjustment">
                <figcaption>Height adjustment can adjust how tall or short you want the monitor to be.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/Guide/viewsonic-tilt.jpg" alt="Tilt">
                <figcaption>Tilt can adjust the angle you look at the monitor.</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </figure>
        <figcaption class="img_source">Source: <a href="https://www.viewsonic.com/library/business/office-ergonomics-the-complete-guide/" target="_blank">Viewsonic</a></figcaption>
        <p>If you do not like the stand that comes with the monitor, you can buy a monitor arm which provides the 4 functions and it also has an added benefit of less space taken on the table. Do note that your monitor need to be VESA compatible and have either a 75mm x 75mm or 100mm x 100mm pattern size.</p>

        <a id="terms_ports"></a>
        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Ports</h2>
        <h3>HDMI</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/Guide/cmple-hdmi-cable.jpg" alt="HDMI Cable" width="20%">
            <figcaption class="img_source">Source: <a href="https://www.cmple.com/30-awg-high-speed-hdmi-cable-15-feet" target="_blank">Cmple</a></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>HDMI is an interface that is most commonly used in TVs, projectors, computers, gaming consoles and monitors. It is good for connecting an HD output to an HD display without affecting high-resolution images and videos. However there are some drawbacks when using HDMI, one being that if you want to use a monitor with a high resolution and high refresh rate, HDMI does not have enough the bandwidth to support it. Additionally if you want to use a G-SYNC monitor with an NVIDIA graphics card, you need to use DisplayPort.</p>
        <h3>DisplayPort</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/Guide/creativecomputing-displayport-cable.jpg" alt="Display Port Cable" width="20%">
            <figcaption class="img_source">Source: <a href="https://www.creativecomputing.net/product_info.php/displayport-male-to-male-locking-cable-2m-dpg-002012-cables-kenable-p-6653" target="_blank">Creative Computing</a></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">DisplayPort is a digital display interface primarily used to transmit video signals to a display unit, such as a monitor. It was developed to replace the old VGA and DVI connectors. DisplayPort has benefits such as higher bandwidth which can support higher resolutions and higher refresh rate monitor, support for both AMD FreeSync and NVIDIA G-SYNC and you can connect multiple monitors to a single DisplayPort connnection on your computer. There is one downside and that it is only supported on computers and monitors.</p>
