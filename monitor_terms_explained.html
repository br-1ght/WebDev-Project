        <h2 id="terms_resolution">Resolution</h2>
        <p>A monitor's resolution describes the visual dimension of any given display. It is expressed in terms of width x height with the unit in pixels. For example, a monitor with the resolution of 1920x1080 has a width of 1920 pixels and a height of 1080 pixels. The higher the resolution of a monitor, the more detailed an image will be as the higher resolution monitor has more pixels than a lower resolution monitor. Additionally, a higher resolution monitor allows more space for content which makes them good choices for multi-tasking. Typically, Higher resolution monitors will be also larger in size and also more expensive. Some of the common monitor resolutions found on the market are 1080p (FHD), 1440p (QHD) and 4K (UHD).</p>
        <p>For work, it is recommended to get a higher resolution such as 1440p (QHD) and 4K (UHD) as it can display images and text more sharper. Furthermore, it allows more space for content which makes them good choices for multi-tasking.</p>
        <p>For gaming, it depends based on how strong your PC is and the type of games you play. The higher the resolution of the monitor, the more Frames Per Second (FPS) will be reduced which leads to gameplay being less smooth. So if you want to play games in high resolutions, you will need a stronger PC that will fit your performance requirements (60, 144, 240 FPS). If you mostly play single player games, it is beneficial to get higher resolutions such as 4K (UHD) as it will add a lot more details making the game more immersive and looking better. If you mostly like to play competitive shooters such as Counter-Strike and Call of Duty, it is beneficial to get a lower resolution such as 1080p (FHD) so that you will have more FPS and you will have less input lag and smoother gameplay.</p>

        <h2 id="terms_refresh_rate">Refresh Rate</h2>
        <p>A monitor's refresh rate refers to how many times per second the screen refreshes the image on it. It is measured in hertz(Hz), and the higher the number the more times per second the monitor refreshes. The higher the refresh rate, the smoother the image will appear.</p>
